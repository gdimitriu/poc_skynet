the proof of concept for skynet auto-upgradable system

It has two projects:

org.gdimitriu.skynet
--
This is the first project and it is a proof of concept of the jaxb-ri and compiling.
The drawback is the single jar.

org.skynet
--
This should be the next generation of skynet with rest and rpc.
The multi-project idea was to have jars which have independent live-cycle.
It start from the first project but it was too dependent on the environment and java sdk.
This was dropped in later 2017 in favor of chappy project.

conclusion
--
Both projects are dead-end of the development of the auto-upgradable systems.
JAXB-RI is ok to generate from xsd classed but finally the system should know the format. The future is to use the ASM. 
On both projects the binding should be generated by exporting the binding project into jar with the bounded libs and manifest. This stage should be automatically done by maven.
